Some of these means include the use of physical objects and activities like oil, handkerchiefs, breath, the laying on of hands and gesticulations. In some spiritual circles these objects and gesticulations are called symbols and tokens.Apart from respecting the position of those who believe in the use of symbols and tokens, I suggest that those who don't believe in their use study the subject more carefully and with humility. Our Lord Jesus Christ employed symbols and tokes in His ministry. No one exercised more faith than Jesus in His earthly life, yet He used symbols and tokens. If He needed symbols and tokens, we also need them.", "date_posted": "2024-09-12T05:04:27Z", "author": 2, "post_image": "image/upload/v1726118370/axs8urzh7ei3orgavqit.jpg", "likes": []}}, {"model": "blog.posts", "pk": 35, "fields": {"title": "Mikel arteta", "content":
